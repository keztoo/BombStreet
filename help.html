<h1>Objective</h1>
The object is to kill as many players <br/>
as quickly as possible. 
<br/><br/>
<h1>Create Map</h1>
You create a location by clicking <br/>
'<b>Start</b>', then walking to the opposite <br/>
diagonal corner  and clicking '<b>Stop</b>'.
<br/><br/>

If you like the area you just walked- <br/>
off click '<b>Accept</b>' to accept the area, <br/>
otherwise click '<b>Reject</b>' and try again.
<br/><br/>

Once you have created 3 locations <br/>
you provide the map name and the <br/>
map is created. 
<br/><br/>
Press your browser's back button to<br/>
return to the main menu.

<h1>Load Map</h1>
Load any previously created map by <br/>
providing the map name and your <br/>
player ID. You may use any number <br/>
as your player ID. If that player <br/>
ID is already playing in that map <br/>
you will need to try a different one.<br/>
Note if you leave a map you must start <br/>
over again with a different player ID.
<br/><br/>

To assemble a bomb you will need 3 <br/>
bomb components; a <b>case</b>, a <b>charge</b> <br/>
and a <b>detonator</b>. <br/>
<b><i>Each bomb requires one of each</i></b>.
<br/><br/>

Once in a map you acquire bomb <br/>
components by standing in a <br/>
location (it will turn red when <br/>
you are inside it) for at least 13 <br/>
seconds. You can see your bomb <br/>
component units and location <br/>
counters on the bottom right <br/>
hand corner of the screen. 
<br/><br/>

You drop a bomb by walking to <br/>
where you want to drop the bomb <br/>
and pressing the <img src="images/bomb_inactive.png"> button <br/>
on the lower right. 
<br/><br/>

Once you have dropped a bomb <br/>
you must <i>arm</i> it in order to <br/>
<i>detonate</i> it. You <i>arm</i> a bomb by <br/>
clicking the <img src="images/bomb_inactive.png"> on the map. It will <br/>
change to the armed state <img src="images/bomb_armed.png">. You <br/>
can <i>dis-arm</i> it by clicking it again.<br/>
You will see the icon change each <br/>
time you click it.
<br/><br/>

Once one or more bombs have been <br/>
armed you detonate them by <br/>
clicking the <img src="images/fire1.png"> button. 
<br/><br/>

If a person (including yourself) is near <br/>
a bomb when it goes off the person who <br/>
detonated the bomb will get a kill and <br/>
the person who was near the bomb <br/>
when it went off will get a hit.
<br/><br/>

<h1>The Winner</h1>
Who the winner is is up to you. 
<br/><br/>

Be the first to 10 hits to win, or <br/>
after 10 minutes be the person with <br/>
the best hit to kill ratio or any <br/>
other combination.
<br/><br/>


<h1>Legend</h1>
The image below shows a typical map. <br/>
The objective of the game is to blow <br/>
up as many people as possible. You <br/>
blow up people by dropping bombs and <br/>
waiting for people to walk by them at <br/>
which point you can detonate your bomb <br/>
and blow them up. 
<br/><br/>
Bombs require one <b>case</b> one <b>charge</b> and <br/>
one <b>detonator</b>. You acquire these items <br/>
as described below ...

in the case factory and the number of cases <br/>
you have acquired. To acquire cases, simply <br/>
stand in the case warehouse (it will turn red <br/>
when you are in it) and the timer will count <br/>
down to zero. Once the timer reaches zero you <br/>
will acquire another case. You will see the <br/>
